Context
We have two Android applications that work in tandem to create a seamless educational experience:
1)  Whiteboard App : A digital whiteboard application primarily used by teachers in classroom settings. It replaces the traditional classroom whiteboard and allows instructors to create and display content in real-time.
2) Notebook App : A personal application used by both students and teachers on their individual Android devices. It replaces traditional notebooks and PDF materials, allowing for digital note-taking and content consumption.
These applications synchronize for a feature called "Quiz" where teachers can control questions from their Whiteboard app, and students can submit answers through their Notebook app.
